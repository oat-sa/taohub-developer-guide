# How to submit an issue

> Proper submittal of issues makes verifying and resolving issues faster and easier.

When submitting a issue, it is important to include all relavent information such as Operating System, versions for TAO and PHP, errors, and the steps to duplicate. You can find a template to follow [here](../Getting\ Started/contributing-to-tao.md#issue-template).

Issues should only be submitted at ***** and other locations will not be reviewed. Once verified, an issue will be available to be worked on and you can claim it to work on yourself or will be available for someone else to pick up.
